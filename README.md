Lab1: HIP programing introduction
In this lab, we will not only delve deeply into the programming techniques of AMD GPUs, but also guide you through practice to master the AMD GPU programming model HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability). Our goal is to start from the basic concepts, gradually build a profound understanding of HIP program development, and ultimately enable you to independently write and run your own HIP programs.

Lab2: A simple RAG system
In this lab, we will explore how to use LLMs to transform documents into knowledge and build your own local knowledge base. You will learn how to construct a local knowledge base and how to gradually build a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmentation Generation) system, which can generate question-and-answer responses based on local documents, making the LLMs generate more trustful content.

Homeworks
Change the query prompt in Step 3. Build RAG chain to make the llm RAG system response in json format.
Replace the the input documentation in Step 2. Indexing your file with your own documentationï¼›
(Adavanced) Is there a better way to improve the performance of RAG system ?
